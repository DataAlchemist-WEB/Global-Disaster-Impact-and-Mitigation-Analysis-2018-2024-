# Global-Disaster-Impact-and-Mitigation-Analysis-2018-2024

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The likely objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of global disasters from 2018 to 2024 to support disaster management, preparedness, and response strategies. The goal is to monitor trends, understand impacts (casualties and economic loss), and assess response performance to enable data-driven decision-making. 

QUESTIONS (KPI)

The dashboard tracks several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to answer critical questions for emergency management and risk assessment:

•	Impact Assessment: What is the total economic loss and the economic loss per casualty?

•	Casualty Analysis: Which disaster type causes the most casualties, and in which regions?

•	Response Efficiency: What is the average response time (12.3 hours) and average recovery time (48 days)?

•	Severity & Trends: How severe are different disasters, and are incidents increasing or decreasing yearly?

•	Resource Allocation: How does the aid amount compare to the economic loss per casualty? 


PROCESS

The image displays the final visualization phase of a typical data analysis project. The preceding steps would have involved: 

1.	Defining Goals & KPIs: Deciding which metrics (like response time or casualties) were important to track.
2.	Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathering raw data from various sources (e.g., government reports, news, aid organizations) and ensuring its quality and consistency.
3.	Analysis & Modeling: Calculating key metrics (averages, totals, indices) and identifying trends.
4.	Dashboard Creation: Building the interactive visualization using a BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Excel, Tableau) to present the insights clearly.
   
DASHBOARD PROJECT INSIGHT

•	Significant Human and Economic Cost: Total economic loss is substantial ($253 billion+), and the cost per casualty ($50,388) is high.
•	High Impact from Specific Events: According to the analysis, a landslide in Bangladesh caused a significant number of casualties (524).
•	Varied Response Metrics: There are distinct differences in average severity and response times across countries and disaster types.
FINAL CONCLUSION
The data highlights the critical need for improved disaster preparedness and response strategies, particularly in high-risk regions. The high economic losses and significant number of casualties underscore the importance of ongoing monitoring and the potential for data-driven decisions to mitigate future impacts. The project likely concludes that targeted aid and improved response times are essential for minimizing harm.
